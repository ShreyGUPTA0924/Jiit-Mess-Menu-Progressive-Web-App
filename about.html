            <h2>The Mess Menu: A Food Adventure (or Nightmare?)</h2>
        <p style="font-size: large; color: aqua;">Welcome to "THE Mess" ; Or as we like to call it, a "food experience" that’s been carefully crafted by elite grp of Jaypee's sadists especially curated for us. The Mess Menu is your one-stop destination for unique meals that can only be described as ‘edible’—some days more so than others. Every dish is a surprise, and sometimes you might even feel surprised by the sheer audacity of what’s served on your plate. After surviving a marathon of tedious classes and submitting assignments just seconds before the deadline, you finally drag yourself to the mess, starving and desperate. But the moment you see what’s on your plate, your body gives up faster than your will to study during midsems. THUD! , you faal & faint............   Now, I personally don’t want you to die—because dying in the hostel premises would automatically gift your roommate a 10 CGPA, and let’s be honest, no one deserves that level of free and easy success unless I am victim's roommate. With this in mind, you’re rushed to the Jaypee Hospital, sorry my bad, just slipped from my mind, MAX hospital by fellow students.</p>

            <p style="font-size: large; color: rgb(255, 123, 0);">For those who expect good food, the mess is where you stand in line for a meal that’s more “ummm.. I will skip today” than “WoW...  so tasty !!” . If you're starving after an entire day of classes and deadlines,  If you're looking for food that's been prepared with love, maybe try a different place—because the only thing lovingly prepared here is the struggle of eating your way through. Sure, it’s hygienic (kudos for that), but let’s be real —> would a pinch more spice bankrupt Jaypee? Oh wait, I heard it’s already broke.</p>

            <p style="font-size: larger; color: chartreuse;">I created this site so we don’t have to waste time scrolling through WhatsApp groups or digging through our gallery to find out what the mess is serving today; Because, let’s face it, I can't change mess menu but I can change the way of looking at it and make it a bit more pleasant. <hr></p>
